"Breakout"-style game for TinyLab

Andre Needham

A "Breakout"-style game roughly based on the Milton-Bradley Microvision game called "Block Buster".

Press button S1 to launch the ball.  Steer your paddle with the potentiometer.  Try to break all blocks.

NOTE: TinyLab's buzzer is on A1.  It doesn't sound very good, so I hooked an 8 ohm, .2 watt speaker between pin 5 and ground.
It's loud enough, sounds good, and only seems to use 9ma or so, way under the maximum pin output current.
Change SPKR_PIN from 5 to A1 if you really want to hear the buzzer.
