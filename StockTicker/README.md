Stock Ticker retrieval program

Andre Needham

Uses the ESP8266 WiFi board to request a stock quote and displays the stock's price and day's change.

Before you upload and run the sketch, change the "ssid" and "password" variables in the sketch to match your WiFi access point.

After you run the sketch, give it about 15 seconds to start up and get the WiFi connection going.
Use buttons S2 and S3 to move up/down the list of stocks.  Use button S4 to select that stock and get the quote.
If you select the ">" entry, you can enter a custom stock ticker.  Use buttons S2/S3 to change the first letter of the ticker.
Use S4 to select that letter, then use S2/S3 to selet the next letter.  After the last letter, press S1 to get the quote.
Be patient, even afer you see 4 dots on the LCD screen, it may be 10 seconds before the quote shows up.
