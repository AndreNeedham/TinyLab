# TinyLab
My TinyLab projects

TinyLab is an Arduino Leonardo compatible board with multiple buttons/leds, an LCD, several sensors, etc., that was created by a group in Turkey called Bosphorous Mechatronics.  Their Indiegogo campaign page is here:

I've made several projects using TinyLab I thought others might like to see, so I've made this repository for them.
